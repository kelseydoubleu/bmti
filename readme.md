# BMTI Test

Biomaterial Type Indicator - a viral personality quiz that teaches people about sustainable building materials by matching them to biomaterial "personalities."

## What it does

BMTI uses the addictive format of personality tests (think "Which Hogwarts house are you?") to make biomaterials engaging and memorable. Users answer questions about their values, aesthetics, and lifestyle, then get matched to a biomaterial like mycelium, hempcrete, bamboo, or cross-laminated timber—complete with anthropomorphized characteristics.

Instead of dry technical specs, each material gets a personality: "You're mycelium—adaptable, networked, and quietly transformative." The goal is to make sustainable materials stick in people's minds through emotional connection rather than data dumps.

## Context

Part of the "Carbon Capital" thesis at Columbia GSAPP. BMTI explores how viral internet culture (personality quizzes, shareable results, aesthetic typing) can be repurposed as climate education infrastructure. If people can remember their Enneagram type, they can remember their biomaterial match.
